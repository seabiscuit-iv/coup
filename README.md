# Coup
 The board game Coup written in python. See the official rules [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/coup/game-rules.php)

### CLI Interface
The command line will prompt you clearly when to answer, with integers only based on the given key. If you see a `(!)`, that indicates that that option would be a bluff. Each prompt takes on average 3 seconds to play, so there is ample time to read the response.

### Running the game
Simply download the coup.py file, open the directory in a terminal, and run the command `python coup.py`
